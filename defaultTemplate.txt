Hi {NAME} - I really like what you’re building at {COMPANY} and would love to help contribute to its success. I've applied to {ROLE} at your company. I’m open to any software/full-stack role/frontend/backend role and would appreciate the opportunity of interviewing for it. I'm willing to do whatever it takes (work in person/study new languages/frameworks) to make it work! I can send you my resume upon request. Thanks a bunch - Christine
